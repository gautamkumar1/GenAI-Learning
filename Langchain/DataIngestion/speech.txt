LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the development of applications that leverage large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT, Google’s Bard, and others. It focuses on enabling developers to create data-aware and agent-driven applications that can integrate seamlessly with custom workflows, external tools, and structured data sources.

Key Features of LangChain
Chains:

Combines multiple LLM calls and other logic into a single sequence or workflow.
Example: Querying a database, summarizing the data, and generating a user-friendly response.
Agents:

Allows applications to dynamically make decisions about which actions to take next based on user input or context.
Example: Querying an API, fetching documents, or interacting with external tools like search engines or calculators.
Memory:

Adds the ability to maintain conversational state over time.
Useful for chatbots or applications requiring context persistence across interactions.
Data Integration:

Facilitates connecting LLMs to external knowledge sources, including databases, APIs, and local files, to enrich responses.
Example: Answering queries using company-specific documentation or real-time data.
Prompt Templates:

Provides utilities to dynamically construct prompts based on user input and other contextual information.
Supports modular and reusable prompt engineering.
Tool Integration:

LangChain can work with various tools such as:
Search Engines: To fetch real-time information.
Python Functions: To perform calculations or complex tasks.
APIs: To interact with external systems.
