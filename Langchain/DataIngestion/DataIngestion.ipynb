It allows JavaScript to be used for server-side scripting, enabling developers to build\\nscalable and high-performance applications.\\nQ: What is the difference between Node.js and JavaScript?\\nA: JavaScript is a programming language primarily used for client-side scripting in browsers, while\\nNode.js is a runtime environment that enables JavaScript to run on the server.\\nQ: What are the key features of Node.js?\\nA: - Non-blocking and event-driven I/O\\n- Built-in asynchronous programming support\\n- Single-threaded but highly scalable\\n- Large ecosystem via npm (Node Package Manager)\\nQ: Explain the event loop in Node.js.\\nA: The event loop is the mechanism that allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations. It\\ncontinuously checks the call stack and event queue for tasks to execute, handling them\\nasynchronously.\\nQ: What is the difference between setImmediate() and process.nextTick()?\\nA: - process.nextTick(): Executes a callback immediately after the current operation finishes, before\\nthe event loop continues.\\n- setImmediate(): Schedules a callback to be executed in the next iteration of the event loop.\\nQ: What are streams in Node.js?\\nA: Streams are objects that enable reading or writing data in chunks, improving performance for\"),\n",

There are four types of streams:\\n- Readable: Read data (e.g., fs.createReadStream).\\n- Writable: Write data (e.g., fs.createWriteStream).\\n- Duplex: Both read and write (e.g., network sockets).\\n- Transform: Modify or transform data (e.g., zlib.createGzip).\\nQ: What is middleware in Node.js?\\nA: Middleware is a function in Express.js that processes requests and responses. It can:\\n- Execute code.\\n- Modify requests and responses.\\n- End the request-response cycle.\\n- Call the next middleware in the stack.\\nQ: How does Node.js handle concurrency?\\nA: Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop for non-blocking operations. For heavy I/O tasks or\\nCPU-intensive operations, it offloads them to worker threads or the thread pool, using the libuv\\nlibrary for handling concurrency.\\nQ: What is clustering in Node.js?\\nA: Clustering allows you to create multiple child processes (workers) sharing the same server port to\\nleverage multi-core CPUs and improve application performance. Example: using the cluster module.\\nQ: What is the purpose of buffer in Node.js?\\nA: The Buffer class is used to handle binary data directly in Node.js, especially when dealing with file\\nsystems, streams, and networking.\\nQ: Explain how to secure a Node.js application.\\nA: - Use HTTPS.\\n- Sanitize and validate user inputs.'),\n",
